              The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is India's national
              space agency, dedicated to advancing space technology and using it
              for national development and scientific exploration. It has
              achieved remarkable milestones in satellite launches,
              interplanetary missions, and cost-effective space innovations,
              earning global recognition.
            </li>
            <li id="A2">
              Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is the space agency of
              India. The organisation is involved in science, engineering and
              technology to harvest the benefits of outer space for India and
              the mankind. ISRO is a major constituent of the Department of
              Space (DOS), Government of India. The department executes the
              Indian Space Programme primarily through various Centres or units
              within ISRO.
            </li>
            <li id="A3">
              ISRO was previously the Indian National Committee for Space
              Research (INCOSPAR), set up by the Government of India in 1962, as
              envisioned by Dr. VikramA Sarabhai. ISRO was formed on August 15,
              1969 and superseded INCOSPAR with an expanded role to harness
              space technology. DOS was set up and ISRO was brought under DOS in
              1972.
            </li>
            <li id="A4">
              The prime objective of ISRO/DOS is the development and application
              of space technology for various national needs. To fulfil this
              objective, ISRO has established major space systemsfor
              communication, television broadcasting and meteorological
              services; resources monitoring and management; space-based
              navigation services. ISRO has developed satellite launch vehicles,
              PSLV and GSLV, to place the satellites in the required orbits.
            </li>
            <li id="A4">
              Alongside its technological advancement, ISRO contributes to
              science and science education in the country. Various dedicated
              research centres and autonomous institutions for remote sensing,
              astronomy and astrophysics, atmospheric sciences and space
              sciences in general function under the aegis of Department of
              Space. ISRO's own Lunar and interplanetary missions along with
              other scientific projects encourage and promote science education,
              apart from providing valuable data to the scientific community
              which in turn enriches science.
            </li>
            <li id="A5">
              The activities of ISRO are guided by its Chairman, who would also
              be the secretary of DOS and Chairman of Space commission the apex
              body that formulates the policies and overseas the implementation
              of the Indian Space Programme.
